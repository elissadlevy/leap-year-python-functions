# Code your functions here!

# 1. Write a function that checks to see if a given year is a leap year, by replacing "pass" with your own code, and returns either the boolean value True or False.
def is_leap_year(year):
   return


# 2. Write a function that takes in the current year and returns a string telling when the next leap year will be.



# 3. Write a function that takes in two years as arguments (a start_year and a last_year), and then prints out every single year between them that is a leap year.
