import leap

# Test out your functions by calling them here. 
# Line 1 imports the file called leap.py, and the function you're creating called is_leap_year() will be stored within that file.
# Remeber that because your functions are defined in a different file, you must reference them with a dot: "leap.is_leap_year(1997)".
# We've written two tests for your first function, so these two should work once you successfully code out the is_leap_year function.

print(leap.is_leap_year(1997))

print(leap.is_leap_year(1996))
